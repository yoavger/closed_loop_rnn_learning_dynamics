# Learning Dynamics of RNNs in Closed-Loop Environments

Code accompanying the paper characterizing the learning dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained in closed-loop environments, where the RNN’s outputs influence future inputs through agent–environment interaction. We contrast this setting with the more conventional open-loop supervised setup, where inputs are independent of past outputs, and demonstrate how closed-loop coupling fundamentally alters the learning dynamics.
